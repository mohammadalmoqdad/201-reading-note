# CSS summerization:
* CH11 summerization:
  * The color property is the responsibole for changing the foreground color.
  * In CSS, color can be specified in three ways:
    * rgb values: controling the values of red, geen, and blue and it written like this `rgb(100,100,90)`
    * hex codes: the six-digit codes and it is written like this: `#ee3e80`
    * color names:  predefined color names that are recognized by browsers and it is written like: Darkgray.
  * By default, most browserwindows have a whitebackground, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background is white you can use thebackground-color property on the `<body>` element.
  * Saturation: Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.
  * Brightness: o how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.
  * When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough ***contrast*** for the text to be legible.
  * RGBA: is a color system like RGB but here we cancontrol the opacity of color.
  * HSLA: cosists of three copmonents:
    * HUE: the color it self
    * saturation: how much grey is clear in that color.
    * brightness: How black and white in that color.
    * Alpha: opacity of color.


# JavaScript
* JavaScript is written with something called Scripts. The **Scripts** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. *
- To know about Scripts:
  - scripts can allow the browser to check the current situation and only perform aset of steps if that action is appropriate. 
  - in a complex script, the browser might use only a subset of the code available at any given time. 
  - Always there is a lot of new terminology to learn. 
### Types of operators:
1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS :
  - EX: x=5;
2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
  - EX: max = 3 * 2; 
3. STRING OPERATORS:
  - EX: saddnes= "money" + "alone";
4. COMPARISON OPERATORS:
  - EX: buy = 3 > 5; 
5. LOGICAL OPERATORS: 
  - EX: y= (7 > 14) || (2 < 4); 

### Comparison:
* *in each condition usually there is one operator and two operands.*
* *The operands are the elements in the both sides of the comparison*
  * like in this example `x<y` , y and x are oprands.
* * The operator is the operation between the two operands.*
  * Like in the previous EX, `<` is the operand.
* *The result of comparison is either `True` or `False`.*
