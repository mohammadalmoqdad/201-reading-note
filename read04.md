## Links:
* Links are created using the `<a>`element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.
* URL: *Uniform Resource Locator*. 
  *  Every web page has its own URL. This is the web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted to visit that specific page.
* An absolute URL starts withthe domain name for that site,and can be followed by the pathto a specific page. If no page isspecified, the site will display thehomepage.
* When linking to other pages within the same site, you canuse relative URLs. These are likea shorthand version of absolute URLs because you do not needto specify the domain name.
* mailto: To create a link that starts upthe user's email program andaddresses an email to a specifiedemail address, you use the <a>element. However, this time thevalue of the href attribute startswith mailto: and is followed bythe email address you want theemail to be sent to.
* Opening links in new window:
  * use thetarget attribute on the opening `<a>` tag. The value of thisattribute should be _blank.
* linking to the same page is done by using I properity and give *href* a different value then enter that value in the feild of id when define another HTML tag 

* positioning in css is trhee types:
  1. Normal flow: The elements being sorted one by one on the page.
  2. Relative Positioning: the surrounded elemnts flow will not be affected but the difference will be by the left & tight positioning.
  3. Absolute positioning: It is taken out of normal flow, and the elements position can be controlled perfectly.
* **Box offset** properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

#### Java Script Variables are used to: 
  - **temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.**
#### Arrays: 
  - **are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.**
#####  `document.getElementByid()` 
  - it is used for chngeing the value of an element that has the i=entered ID
#### Functions:
* let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. 
* parameter: prvided inputs for funcyions.
* return value: when their is a result of the function expected to be returnd.
* Different between Arguments and Parameters:

* IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTIONEXPRESSIONS (llFE): Pronounced "iffy," these functions are not givena name. Instead, they are executed once as theinterpreter comes across them.  
* The final parentheses (shown on green) in LIFE after the closing curly brace of the code block tell the interpreter to call the function immediately. The grouping operators (shown on pink) are parentheses there to ensure the intrepretert treatsthis as an expression. 
* **VARIABLE SCOPE** : The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be usedwithin your code. 
* LOCAL VARIABLES & GLOBAL VARIABLES :
  * Local is When a variable is created inside a function using the var keyword, it can only be used in that function. 
  * Global is If you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script.
