# Text Summerization:
* The spaces around the `a` tag is added by the browser by default .
Their two ways for add a text upper and down of the origional text:
  * The `<sup>` element : it can be used for superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts.
  * The `<sub>` element: it is used for subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas.
* The browser treats the spaces in the code and make them one space. This is known as **white space collapsing**.
* To add a line in the code between severals block their is a tag called `<hr>`.
* The use of the `<strong>` element indicates that its content has strong importance.
* , the
* `<cite>` element can be used to indicate where the citation is from when write a name of a film or a book.
*  The hCard microformat for adding physical address information to your markup.

# Java Script Summerization:
* *comments* to explain what your code does. They help make the code easier to read and understand. And it is to types:
  1. Multi-Line comment, EX: `/* any comment*/`
  2. Single-Line comment, EX: `// any line of code`
* Variable is a place where the information being stored.
* The default value of the variable before defining is ***undefined***
* DT of vsriables:
  * Numiric: it involves the numbers.
  * String: it invoves anything between qutations.
  * boolean: which is either `true` or `false`.
  * Also there are *arrays*, *objects* and `*null*`.
* Each opened `(`,`"`,`'`,`{` should has a closing part similar to it.
* To escape the jub of qutations or similar things we can use  `\` for that.
* Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index. This can be used to access specific items in the array.
* Arithmitic Operators:

* Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself.
#### To determine which path to take:
  1. EVALUATIONS You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results. 
  2. DECISIONS: Using the results ofevaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down. 
  3. LOOPS
There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly. 
* Logical operators return `true` or `false`.
  * They are used to compare the result of more than one comparison operator.
  * Those operators are: 
    - `&&` : logical AND; only when both operands is true the result become true.
    - `||`: Logical Or; one of the operands is true the result will be true.
    - `!`: logical not; the oposite vallue.
