## Tables:
* Tables essentially involve three main elements:
  1. td: which is the block or the container for each cell.
  2. tr: tells the browser to go to the next line.
  3. th: the head of table elements.
* another way to describe the contennt of tables(both ways can be used together and the second one is for better desgin and reading for the content):
  1. `<thead>`: The headings of the table should sit inside the <thead> element. 
  2. `<tbody>`: The body should sit inside this element.  
  3. `<tfoot>`:The footer belongs inside this element.
* propereties for table can changge the design:
  *  border="2": it gives the borders style to be duplicated or bold by changing the value 2.
  * bgcolor="#efefef": for the background of the cells
  * rawspan and collspan: to make cells of a table span more than one row or column.

## Objects:
  * There are three ways to change/add the value for the object attribute:
    1. this.`properity name`
      * EX: this.name="Ali".
    2. `object name`.`properity name`
      * cat.name="sherry"
    3. `object name`['`properity name`']
      * cat['name']="sherry".

  * To call the function we have to writ it Like this ex:
    * *object name*.*function name*(): to tell the browser to give me the function in that object exaclty.
  * Ways of CREATing THE OBJECT:
    * LITERAL NOTATION :
      - ex: var hotel = {} 
    * OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION :
      - var hotel = new Object();
